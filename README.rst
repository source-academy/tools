demo-assessments
================
Files in the demo-assessments directory allow you to build a docker image
containing a local copy of the *Source Academy* cadet_ and `cadet-frontend`_.
This Soure Academy pulls from a local cs1101s repository, and is thus useful for
testing assessments XML files that you may be authoring.
